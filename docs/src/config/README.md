# Configuration

The Crackheadbot has a few settings to customise it.
The available settings are welcome messages, leave messages, welcome channel, leave channel and levels.

## Available settings

To see all available settings, run the following command:

```
crack settings
```

![All settings](/Crackheadbot/images/all_settings.png)

All available settings are now listed. The command to see the current value of each setting is listed under the name, so for "Welcome messages" its `crack settings welcome`

## Getting a specific value

To get the value of a setting run `crack settings` followed by the setting you want to see the value of. So for example, to see the current welcome channel that is set up, run the following command:

```
crack settings welcomechannel
```

![Current welcome channel](/Crackheadbot/images/current_welcome_channel.png)

## Modifying a value

To modify a setting's value, run `crack settings` with the setting you want to modify and the new value. So to turn welcome messages on, run

```
crack settings welcome on
```
